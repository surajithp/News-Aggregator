# News-Aggregator API



Objective: Build a RESTful API that allows users to fetch news articles from multiple sources based on their preferences.


Project Description: In this project, we will create a RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and NPM packages. The API will allow users to register, log in, and set their news preferences (e.g., categories, sources). The API will then fetch news articles from multiple sources using external news APIs (e.g., NewsAPI). The fetched articles should be processed and filtered asynchronously based on user preferences.

Implemens RESTful API with the following endpoints:

POST /register: Register a new user.

POST /login: Log in a user.

GET /preferences: Retrieve the news preferences for the logged-in user.

PUT /preferences: Update the news preferences for the logged-in user.

GET /news: Fetch news articles based on the logged-in user's preferences.
